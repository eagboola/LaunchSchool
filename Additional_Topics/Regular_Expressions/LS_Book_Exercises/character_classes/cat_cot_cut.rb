  sleep on my cot with me, but they cut my sleep
  short with acrobatics when breakfast time rolls
  around. I need a robotic cat feeder."

=end

str = "My cats, Butterscotch and Pudding, like to
sleep on my cot with me, but they cut my sleep
short with acrobatics when breakfast time rolls
around. I need a robotic cat feeder."

pattern = /[cb][aou]t/i
pattern2 = /[bBcC][aAoOuU]t/

puts str.match(pattern)
puts str.match(pattern2)
