'T' stands for 'Teardown' in the 'SEAT' testing approach. Teardown occurs after each test is performed (in the same that Setup occurs before each test is run) to ensure that no artifacts from previous tests conflict with the next. This can be implemented with #teardown with some code to log collected info or close connections to files or databases.
