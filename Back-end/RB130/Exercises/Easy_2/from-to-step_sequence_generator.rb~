=begin

  `Range#step` iterates over a Range of values where each value is the previous plus the `step` value, and returns the original range.

  PROBLEM
  =======
  Write a method that operates in the same way as `Range#step` without being called on a Range.
  The method should take (3) arguments : the starting value, the end value, and the `step` value.
  The method should take a block which will be called on successive iteration values.


=end

step(1, 10, 3) { |value| puts "value = #{value}" }

# value = 1
# value = 4
# value = 7
# value = 10
