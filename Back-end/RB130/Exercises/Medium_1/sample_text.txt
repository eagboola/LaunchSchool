The boy's name was Santiago. Duk was falling as the boy arrived with hs herd
at an abandoned church. The roof had fallen in long ago, and an enormous
sycamore had grown on the pot where the sacristy had once stood.

He decided to spend the night there. He saw to it that all the sheep entered
through the ruined gate, and then laid some planks across it to prevent the
flock from wandering away during the night. There wre no wolves in the region,
but once an animal had strated during the night, and the boy had had to spend
the entire next day searching for it.

He swept the floor with his jacket and lay down, using the book he had just
finished reading as a pillow. He told himself that he would have to start
reading thicker books: they lasted longer, and made more comfortable pillows.

It was still dark when he awoke, and, looking up, he could see the stars
through the half-destroyed roof.

I wanted to sleep a little longer, he thought. He had had the same dream that
night as a week ago, and once again he had awakened before it ended.

He arose and, taking up his crook, began to awaken the sheep that still slept.
He had noticed that, as soon as he awoke, most of his animals also began to
stir. It was as if some mysterious energy bound his life to that of the sheep,
with whom he had spent the past two years, leading them through the
countryside in search of food and water. "They are so used to me that they
know my schedule," he muttered. Thinking about that for a moment, he realized
that it could be the other way around: that it was he who had become
accustomed to their schedule.
